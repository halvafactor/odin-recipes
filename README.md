# Odin Recipes

This is my first project for The Odin Project. It should showcase my ability to
make a very basic HTML website with headings, paragraphs, ordered and unordered
lists, pictures, and a basic file structure with that uses relative paths 
between several pages. Also it's my first time using git apart from the repo I
made to test things out.
