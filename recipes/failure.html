        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I taught myself this recipe by flailing around and trying it over
            and over. I have gotten really good at making this version of failure 
            over the years, but it's a very forgiving recipe, so feel free to try 
            any substitution or even just make it up as you go along.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups entitlement</li>
            <li>1 cup reluctance to ask for help</li>
            <li>6 heaping tablespoons procrastination*</li>
            <li>7 grams expectations (unrealistic if possible)</li>
            <li>1.5 tablespoons severe urgency</li>
            <li>impatience, to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <p>*Note: if you don't any procrastination, you can just wait until
            you get some. You can also wait for inspiration.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine entitlement and reluctance to ask for help into
                three extra-long to-do lists. Make sure to remove all traces
                of prioritization. Set aside for as long as necessary.</li>
            <li>Put the procrastination in the microwave and walk away, you 
                can come back to it later when you get tired of cooking.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat your expectations until they're shimmering,
                then add your severe urgency and fry until it's smoking.</li>
            <li>At this point, the stuff on the stove should be burnt to an
                inedible crisp. Return to your procrastination that you 
                stashed in the microwave and just see whether it's changed
                at all.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle on a little bit of impatience and stash it back in the 
                microwave, just in case that changes anything.</li>
            <li>Quit.</li>
        </ol>
