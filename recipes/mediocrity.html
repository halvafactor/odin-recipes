        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is perfect for a weeknight dinner, no fuss no musss. Not
        everything has to be perfect, or crappy, sometimes you just need
        something to be fine.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Dried pasta, any shape</li>
            <li>One jar of tomato sauce, flavored with basil or garlic if 
                you're feeling fancy</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese, a bunch</li>
            <li>Butter, a stick at most</li>
            <li>Salt</li>    
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Salt a big pot of water and bring it to a boil</li>
            <li>Dump some of the red sauce into a small pot and set it over
                low heat. Ignore it for a while. Put some olive oil in if 
                you're really motivated.</li>
            <li>When the water comes to a boil, grab a few handfuls of pasta
                and throw them in. Stir, then look at the box to see how long 
                to cook. Set a timer for that amount of time.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, grate your parmesan cheese if you bought it in a 
                block. Otherwise, if you bought it pre-grated, just dump out 
                a bunch onto a plate. Set aside.</li>
            <li>When the timer goes off, drain your pasta.</li>
            <li>Put the big pot back on the stove over low heat and melt 
                some butter in it. My personal opinion is there can never be
                too much, but use your judgment.</li>
            <li>Put pasta back into big pot with melted butter, pour on warmed
                up red sauce, and stir in a giant pile of parmesan.</li>
            <li>Eat a totally normal dinner!</li>
        </ol>
