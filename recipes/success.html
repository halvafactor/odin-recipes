        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I love nothing more than a recipe with a family history, and this 
            one is no exception. My grandparents used to make it back in the 
            old country (they were very progressive for their time, and both
            my grandmother and my grandfather liked to work on successful
            projects and then enjoy a nice warm bowl of success when they were
            done). This is one of the oldest recipes in the book, and there are 
            as many ways to do it as there are people in the world. But it just
            tastes better when you know where it came from, you know? So please,
            enjoy some good old fashioned success.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 to 2 cups confidence</li>
            <li>an equal measure of humility</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons of patience</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ambition</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons creativity</li>
            <li>sense of humor, to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Over medium low heat, bring your confidence to a simmer. It
                will take some time to come up to temperature, but the slower
                this part goes, the better the result will be. Meanwhile,
                daydream about what you want to achieve. </li>
            <li>Once you're good and psyched up, you need to take yourself
                down a peg. Add your humility to the pan and turn up heat
                to high. This part will hurt and smell like burning — don't 
                worry, it's supposed to do that. Remember that you're a 
                beginner and you have no idea what you're doing. Then, when 
                you start to feel a lot of doubt, proceed to Step 3.</li>
            <li>Crush up patience into a fine, spreadable paste. Add some of
                it to the pan to help you tolerate feeling like a fraud and a 
                scaredy-cat and set the rest aside for later.</li> 
            <li>Keep cooking everything while you make a plan to work on
                your project every day and other plans to hold yourself to
                it. Keep tasting, and add humor as necessary, especially
                if it ever starts to taste like frustration or rage.</li>
            <li>Mix creativity into your patience paste and stir it slowly
                into the pan. You want it to blend in smoothly so that there
                are no clumps and it's evenly distributed into the confidence 
                and humility mix. You can ask anyone who tastes the finished
                to guess the secret ingredient.</li>       
        </ol>
